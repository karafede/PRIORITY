# PRIORITY
 <strong> PRIORITY  </strong> is the acronim of Platform for the tRansition to sustanInable zerO-caRbon mobilITY. 
It is a digital platform for  <strong> urban mobility  </strong> instrument for decision makers offering the possibility to aggregate  <strong> mobility data  </strong> within   <strong> traffic zones  </strong> for analysis of  <strong> travel demand, polluting emissions, energy consumption and externalities  </strong> in the metropolitan city of Rome (Italy). The platform has been designed to retrieve mobility insights from 

Floating Car Data, General   <strong>(FCD)  </strong> Transit Feed Specification data  <strong> (GTFS)  </strong> and public transport data. 
PRIOIRTY has been Built with the  <strong> Python Flask  </strong> framework to allow the users to easily explore data through a dashboard together with interactive maps. This platform integrates real-world mobility data with modelled data to enhance the reconstruction of individual travel. In addition, it offers the option to perform  <strong> online statistics  </strong> over traffic zones upon a mouse click with the possibility to visualize  <strong> hourly profiles  </strong> of several traffic variables as well as polluting emissions, energy consumption and externalities. 

The platform allows exploitation of mobility data such as to make  <strong> spatial and temporal aggregations  </strong>, to compute  <strong> desire lines  </strong> between origins and destinations and, to highlight traffic zones crossed by trips originating from a specific zone. Additionally, the PRIORITY platform offers the possibility to  <strong> retrieve Points of Interests (POI)  </strong> from the OpenStreetMap database and to show an updated charging network for electric vehicles through the direct connection with Open Charge Map.
